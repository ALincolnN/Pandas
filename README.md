# Pandas

The project entails the Pandas library for Data Science and Analysis.

I will be interacting with a csv file to be able to manipulate the data and practice python with Pandas.

Basically what is happening in the projet is going through methods and different functionalities in the Pandas Library, commenting on what the method will achieve and then commenting out the method itself after testing and certifying that its functioning correctly.

It is more of a beginners' level of learning but its worthwhile to kickstart your knowledge of Pandas before advancing to Guru-level stuff.
